# Adversarial Machine Learning in a Speech Emotion Recognition Scenario
This is my master degree thesis project and related experiments: it consists of an analysis of the behavior of a speech emotion recognition model when attacked via Adversarial Examples.
The project includes several Jupyter Notebooks covering the various phases of the project (data preprocessing, model training, attack phases, etc...). The scripts expect that the datasets have already been downloaded locally to the paths specified during the metadata extraction phase.
